\chapter{Research Methodology} \label{chapter_four}

The fourth chapter is typically named {\em Realisation and Evaluation}. Here you give the most important technical details (more details are given in the appendix). Then you evaluate your approach -- typically by test runs. Describe the data used for the tests carefully. Give meaningful graphs. The fourth chapter together with the appendix should give all information which is necessary that somebody else can do the same test runs as you did.
