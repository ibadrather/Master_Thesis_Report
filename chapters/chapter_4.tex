\chapter{Research Methodology} \label{chapter_four}

What I am doing and how am I doing it. Various techniques, mathematics, approaches and why them. Benefits of each approach and their drawbacks.

\section{Dataset Information}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyse Real Collected data to calculate Omega, Tow and Amplitude. 
\item Background of Dataset: How it was generated. 
\item What was the thought process. 
\item What kind of data we have.
\item Robustness of technique of Data Collection/Generation.
\end{itemize}
\section{Structuring of Data}
Data can be used in multiple ways. Explaining each way and why is it a good or a bad idea. What to put in networks. Sticking to realism.

\section{Mathematics for stabilisation}
Here we will see what exactly we are trying to find out: (R, T)

\section{Training and Testing of Various Neural Networks}
We will use various Neural Network types and Architectures.

\begin{itemize}
\item CNNs
\item RNNs: LSTMS 
\item Transformers
\item Temporal Fusion Transformers
\item CNNs
\item Resnets
\end{itemize}

\section{Image Stabilisation based on the Techniques Used}
We will see the Stabilized Videos and discuss about how they look visually to different people.
