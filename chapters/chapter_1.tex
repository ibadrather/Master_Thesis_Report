\chapter{Introduction} \label{chapter_one}

An introduction gives the motivation of your work:
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the topic?
\item Why is this relevant?
\item Why is this exciting?
\item What concrete problem do you want to solve?
\end{itemize} 
State clearly your research question. \\
The end of the introduction gives an advanced organizer for the rest of the thesis, i.e., a sentence for each chapter.

Typically you cite in one of the following ways: This algorithm is based on {\sc GraphPlan} \citep{Blum97}. \citet{Blum97} introduced {\sc GraphPlan} as an efficient algorithm for plan construction for finite domains.
